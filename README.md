TinkerPy
========

A structure for tinkering with syntax proposals.

The goal of this is less to propose a specific syntax, and more to be a
template for ANY syntax proposal. Take a copy of this project, change the
alterations being done, and start playing with the code.

Syntax proposals are MUCH easier to discuss when you can play with them than
when you have to discuss everything abstractly!
